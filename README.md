# lazyvpn
## DESCRIPTION
lazyVPN is a shell script dedicated to automatically install and setup OpenVPN server in one process.
It's based and tested on Ubuntu Server 14.04 and intended to be used on VPS/VDS run in OpenVZ containers.
Current version is just an alpha and has quite dirty code but it does what it was designed for: fast and simple install and deploy private VPN server.
